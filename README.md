THE GROCER

Description
The Grocer app streamlines your shopping experience by allowing you to easily create, manage, and share your grocery lists. With features like categorization of items, and budget tracking it helps ensure you never forget an essential ingredient. Whether youâ€™re shopping solo or with family, a grocery list app simplifies the process and enhances your efficiency.

The Grocer is a single page web application that allows the user to customize their grocery needs for their families. The user has the ability to add a new item to be bought, edit the item, remove an item, and strikethrough an item if the item is already in their cart while currently shopping. The user also has the capabillity to write down some notes attached to a specific grocery item they have entered. An example of a note would be the location or the name of the store where the grocery item would be bought. Another example of a note would be more specifications attached to the item, like notes for the milk item, would be whole organic milk.

Technologies Used
The developers have used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and are skilled in creating this dynamic and visually appealing single page web applications. HTML serves as the backbone, structuring the content, while CSS enhances the design, allowing for responsive layouts. JavaScript brings interactivity to the web, enabling features like events such as clicking, submitting forms, and real-time updates. Together, these technologies empowered the developers to build this user-friendly grocery app that engage and inform users, making them essential tools in real life shopping.

Challenges and Future
The developers have faced several challenges that complicated the process of building this effective single page website. One common issue is ensuring the responsive design, as different browsers may render elements inconsistently. Additionally, optimizing website performance is crucial, as slow loading times can deter users. Putting education into practice can be a significant struggle for many, as it often involves bridging the gap between knowledge and real-world application. The developers found it challenging to translate classroom concepts into practical skills, leading to feelings of uncertainty and frustration. Additionally, the pressure to perform in a professional environment can exacerbate this struggle, as individuals grapple with limited experience and the complexities of actual project. Overcoming this hurdle required a supportive learning environment, a lot of trial and error, and multiple opportunities for hands-on experiences that reinforce classroom teachings. One of the stretch goals that we have not achieved in this project is giving the users the capability to attach an image to a specific grocery item, clearing the whole list, and making a sorting button. 

How to Install and use the project
1. Starting the server 
    All of our grocery list object datas are stored in the `db.json` file. You can access this using a JSON server by running `json-server --watch db.json` in your terminal to start the server and keep it running.
    Link `http://localhost:3000/categoryName` for specific category names, and `http://localhost:3000/groceries` for access to the grocery item object.
    To access a specific grocery item, attach an "id" into the url ex: `http://localhost:3000/groceries/1` 
    Open another tab in your terminal and open `index.html` to view the page in your browser. 
2. Adding a new grocery item
    If you click on the "Add new item" it will expose a form for the user to fill out everytime the user wants to add a new grocery item in her list, once you click the "Submit" button the form or by pressing "enter" will automatically close for you. The new item will be listed under the specific category it falls.
3. Editing a current grocery item
    The user will click on the "Edit" button aligned on the specific grocery item that the user wants to edit. An "edit form" will pop out, and is currently pre-populated with the information stored on the specific item. The user then can edit any section or all of them. The user will click the "Submit Changes" or press "enter" button once she is happy with her editing. 
4. Deleting a current grocery item
    The user can remove or delete a specific item that she wishes to by clicking on the "Delete" button aligned to the specific gocery item the user wants to delete. 
5. Strikethrough an item
    The developers wanted to enhance a user's grocery shopping experience by allowing the users to use a strikethrough on specific grocery item, that can be helpful on real-time grocery shopping. The user will click on the grocery item name, ex "Garlic" and the garlic name will have a strikethrough appearance meaning that the item "garlic" is already in her cart. The user has the capability to undo the strikethrough by pressing on the item name again. 
6. Estimated total cost
    The Grocer shows the user a "Total Estimated Cost" on the bottom right of the web application. The total is computed by computing the sum inputed on all the grocery item prices.
